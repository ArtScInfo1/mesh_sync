myMesh_faces.txt - Containing the informations about Faces (eg. "1 2 3 4")


Additionally other files can be generated:


myMesh_weight.txt - Containing on each line (for each Vertex) one value for each Vertex Group. (eg. "0.25 0.75")


myMesh_verts_neighbors.txt - Indexes of neighbors vertices (eg. "0 1 2 3")


myMesh_face_neighbors.txt - Indexes of neighbors faces (eg. "0 1 2 3")


### Importing

While importing a mesh the only mandatory file is a Vertices file, all the other are mandatory. Neighbors are not used while importing inside Blender.
