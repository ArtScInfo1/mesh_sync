# MeshSync

After installing the python file mes_sync.py, MeshSync will appear in the Object Data panel, if a Mesh Object is selected. 

## Blender

### Exporting

According to the chosen settings the following files can be created:


*myMesh_vertices.txt* - Containing the informations about Vertices (eg. "0.0, 0.0, 0.0")


*myMesh_edges.txt* - Containing the informations about Edges (eg. "1 2")


*myMesh_faces.txt* - Containing the informations about Faces (eg. "1 2 3 4")



Additionally other files can be generated:


*myMesh_weight.txt* - Containing on each line (for each Vertex) one value for each Vertex Group. (eg. "0.25 0.75")


*myMesh_verts_neighbors.txt* - Indexes of neighbors vertices (eg. "0 1 2 3")


*myMesh_face_neighbors.txt* - Indexes of neighbors faces (eg. "0 1 2 3")


### Importing

While importing a mesh the only mandatory file is a Vertices file, all the other are mandatory. Neighbors are not used while importing inside Blender.

### Export

Check the GH examples for exporting. The process is quite straightforward, plug a mesh, a destination folder and a Boolean Button for export the mesh data. It will automatically create the Vertices and Faces files.

Optionally, some values from 0 to 1 can be exported as well as Weight file. Make sure that the number of vertices and values match.

### Import

While importing three different components can be used, according to how much informations you want to import. The Advanced component allow to read all possible data.
